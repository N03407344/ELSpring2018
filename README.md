Pi Camera Project

Goal
The goal of this project was to design a camera mechanism controlled by a web interface. This mechanism had to allow the camera to be rotated both vertically and horizontally. The web interface needed to be able to move the camera mechanism in a controlled fashion, take a still picture at any point, store pictures with timestamps, and allow users to view all pictures taken.

What was acheived
All goals stated above were acheived through the course of working on this project. Work was split evenly among group members.
Emily Venuto (50% of the work):

  •	Design web interface
  •	Code camera functionality to take pictures from the website
  •	Set up the database to hold pictures and timestamps
  •	Allow pictures to be viewed through the web interface

Philip Leung (50% of the work):
  •	Code functionality to control both servo motors from the web interface
  •	Assemble the pan-tilt servo mechanism
  •	Wire the pi-servo mechanism

Usability
If you wish to re-create this project, you will be able to do so by following the instructions in the README.md in the code directory.
